          <p><li><h2>1. Being deaf doesn’t mean that you can’t hear at all.
            Many people who are deaf can hear some sounds, they just can’t hear them clearly. Other people are profoundly deaf; they can’t hear at all. Hearing people shouldn’t make assumptions about what people can or can’t hear, but rather should ask.</h2></li>
            
            <li><h2>    2. It takes a lot of effort for many people to interact with a hearing world.
            Most of the world is designed for people who can hear. It takes a lot of effort for those who cannot hear or who cannot hear well to do daily tasks, interact with people socially, and simply live. This can be exhausting and frustrating, and it can be difficult to maintain a good mood when having to deal with this.</h2></li>

            
            <li><h2>   3. Hearing aids don’t make sounds any clearer.
            Hearing aids make sounds louder but not any clearer, so speaking louder doesn’t help someone with a hearing aid. Enunciating more clearly and distinctly may, but even that may not be helpful.</h2></li>
            
            <li><h2>   4. Being able to see someone speak can help.
            Even those who cannot read lips can sometimes pick up context better by seeing someone speak. Facial expressions and non-verbal language can also help. Everyone is different. At the same time…</h2></li>
            
            <li><h2>    5. Not everyone can read lips
            Just because someone can pick up a few things from seeing your lips doesn’t mean that they can read lips. Lip reading is a rare skill and it’s difficult to pick up many people pronounce things differently which vastly changes the way their lips look So even if someone can read lips it isn’t reliable most people who do read lips can only pick up less than half of the conversation. </h2></li>         
            
            <li><h2>      6. Sign language isn’t universal. There are regional differences for sign language, and sign language is a true language — there are idioms in sign language just as in English and it is separate from other languages. It also comes with its own culture. However there are some simpler forms of sign language that you can learn if your goal is simple communication.</h2></li>
            
            <li><h2>   7. Deaf people can feel ignored or neglected.  So it is pretty much beter to get yourself to interact with other cause once you do so people will realise you are as good as them in many things and you wont hsve to be loner.</h2></li>
