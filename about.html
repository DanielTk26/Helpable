          <h1>Welcome To Helpable !!!</h1>
          <p>Helpable is an app created by Daniel Thomas to help those who are deaf and dumb.
             People should not get discouraged or left helpless due to their disability.
             The main aim of this app is to let deaf and dumb people lead normal lives.
             The deaf and dumb may have lost something that everyone has. But they definitely
             have a unique thing that no one has !!!
          </p>

          <p>How to use this app ? If you are a deaf person, just go to the first option
             that has the picture of a person covering his ear. This leads you to our voice-text
             converter page where you just have to click on the button "Convert Voice into Text"
             It starts recording whatever another person is speaking to you and displays it in a
             text form on the screen when he has stopped speaking. So even though you are deaf,
             you can read whatever the person is speaking.
          </p>

            
          <p>If You are a dumb person, click on the second option on our homepage that has the image 
            of a prson covering his mouth. This leads you to Text to Speech Converter. Here there is 
            a text input box where you can type in whatever you want to tell the person. After typing 
            whatever you wanted to tell that person, click on the button "Tell". When you click on 
            this button, your device automatically starts telling the person what you wanted to tell him.
            So, even though you cant speak, this app tells the person what you just wrote on the text
            input box. 
          </p>
